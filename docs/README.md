# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management knowledge base! This collection of documents provides a comprehensive guide to how we plan, execute, and continuously improve our projects. Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for specific process guidance, this README will help you navigate our project management approach.

## About Our Approach

OctoAcme follows an **iterative, customer-first approach** to project management that emphasizes delivering value through small, testable increments. Our processes are built on principles of clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. We believe in empowering teams with well-defined roles while maintaining the flexibility to adapt and improve continuously.

Our project management framework covers the **complete project lifecycle**—from initial problem identification and stakeholder alignment through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Each phase includes clear decision gates, defined artifacts, and communication cadences to ensure transparency and alignment. We manage risks proactively, maintain comprehensive documentation, and use retrospectives to convert learnings into actionable improvements. By combining structured processes with a culture of continuous improvement, we enable teams to deliver high-quality results efficiently while building institutional knowledge that scales across the organization.
