# Risk Management Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist helps Risk Managers and Project Managers systematically identify, assess, and manage risks throughout the project lifecycle. Use this template to ensure comprehensive risk coverage and consistent risk management practices.

## Risk Identification Phase

### Initial Risk Assessment (During Project Initiation)
- [ ] Review project scope and objectives for potential risks
- [ ] Conduct risk brainstorming session with team leads
- [ ] Review similar past projects for common risk patterns
- [ ] Identify external dependencies and third-party risks
- [ ] Assess technical complexity and unknowns
- [ ] Identify resource constraints and availability risks
- [ ] Review regulatory, compliance, and security requirements
- [ ] Assess stakeholder risks and alignment challenges

### Ongoing Risk Identification (Throughout Project)
- [ ] Review risks during weekly project sync meetings
- [ ] Monitor for new risks during sprint planning
- [ ] Gather risk input during stand-ups and retrospectives
- [ ] Review incident reports for systematic risks
- [ ] Monitor dependency changes with partner teams
- [ ] Track changes in requirements or scope

## Risk Assessment

### For Each Identified Risk
- [ ] Document risk description clearly and specifically
- [ ] Assign unique risk ID for tracking
- [ ] Assess impact (High/Medium/Low)
  - High: Could cause project failure or major delays
  - Medium: Could cause moderate delays or quality issues
  - Low: Minor impact, manageable within normal processes
- [ ] Assess likelihood (High/Medium/Low)
  - High: >50% probability of occurring
  - Medium: 20-50% probability of occurring
  - Low: <20% probability of occurring
- [ ] Calculate risk priority (Impact × Likelihood)
- [ ] Assign risk owner responsible for monitoring and mitigation
- [ ] Document potential impact on schedule, budget, quality, or scope
- [ ] Identify triggers or early warning signs

## Risk Mitigation Planning

### For High and Medium Priority Risks
- [ ] Develop specific mitigation strategy
  - Avoid: Change approach to eliminate the risk
  - Reduce: Take actions to lower impact or likelihood
  - Transfer: Shift risk to third party (insurance, contract)
  - Accept: Acknowledge risk and prepare contingency
- [ ] Define specific mitigation actions with owners
- [ ] Set target dates for mitigation actions
- [ ] Identify required resources for mitigation
- [ ] Develop contingency plan for high-impact risks
- [ ] Document fallback options if mitigation fails
- [ ] Estimate cost of mitigation vs. cost of risk occurring

## Risk Monitoring and Tracking

### Weekly Risk Review
- [ ] Update status of all active risks
- [ ] Review progress on mitigation actions
- [ ] Check for trigger indicators
- [ ] Reassess impact and likelihood based on new information
- [ ] Add newly identified risks to register
- [ ] Close resolved or no-longer-relevant risks
- [ ] Escalate high-priority risks to Project Manager
- [ ] Update risk register documentation

### Monthly Risk Reporting
- [ ] Prepare risk trend analysis
- [ ] Document risk metrics (total, by priority, resolved)
- [ ] Highlight top risks for stakeholder awareness
- [ ] Report on effectiveness of mitigation strategies
- [ ] Recommend process improvements based on patterns
- [ ] Share lessons learned from resolved risks

## Risk Communication

### Communication Checklist
- [ ] Include top 3-5 risks in weekly status reports
- [ ] Provide risk updates in stakeholder meetings
- [ ] Ensure all team members understand their role in risk mitigation
- [ ] Escalate critical risks immediately (don't wait for scheduled meetings)
- [ ] Document risk decisions and rationale
- [ ] Share risk register with relevant stakeholders
- [ ] Conduct risk retrospective at project milestones

## Risk Register Maintenance

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] Maintain risk register in accessible location (project wiki, shared doc)
- [ ] Use consistent risk ID format (e.g., RISK-001)
- [ ] Keep risk descriptions clear and jargon-free
- [ ] Update risk status promptly when changes occur
- [ ] Archive closed risks with closure rationale
- [ ] Tag risks by category (technical, resource, external, etc.)
- [ ] Link risks to related project items (epics, milestones, dependencies)

## Risk Review Meetings

### Preparation
- [ ] Distribute updated risk register 24 hours before meeting
- [ ] Highlight new or changed risks for discussion
- [ ] Prepare recommendations for risk prioritization
- [ ] Gather updates from risk owners

### During Meeting
- [ ] Review all high-priority risks
- [ ] Discuss new risks and assign owners
- [ ] Review mitigation progress
- [ ] Make decisions on risk response strategies
- [ ] Document action items with owners and due dates

### After Meeting
- [ ] Update risk register with decisions
- [ ] Distribute meeting notes and action items
- [ ] Follow up with risk owners on assigned actions
- [ ] Schedule follow-up discussions for complex risks

## Project Milestone Risk Reviews

### At Each Major Milestone
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive risk assessment
- [ ] Review effectiveness of risk management approach
- [ ] Update risk management plan if needed
- [ ] Close risks that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Identify risks for upcoming phase
- [ ] Document lessons learned about risk management
- [ ] Adjust risk management processes based on learnings

## Templates and Tools

## Best Practices

- [ ] Cultivate a "no blame" culture for risk identification
- [ ] Encourage team members to speak up about concerns
- [ ] Act on identified risks promptly
- [ ] Keep risk discussions focused and time-boxed
- [ ] Use data and evidence to assess risks objectively
- [ ] Review and update risk management processes regularly
- [ ] Celebrate successful risk mitigation
- [ ] Learn from risks that materialized
- [ ] Don't let risk management become bureaucratic overhead
- [ ] Balance thoroughness with pragmatism
